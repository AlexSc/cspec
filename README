CSpec:  Behaviour-driven development in C
========================================

Overview
--------

CSpec is a Behaviour-driven Development (http://behaviour-driven.org/) framework for C.
It provides a spec framework for describing the behavior of the functions of your system.
The syntax is inspired from RSpec (http://rspec.info/) to be as legible as possible.
The source code is as portable and as light as possible to make it easy to run the library on embedded devices.


Spec framework sample
---------------------

	See main.c and fabs_descr.c in directory sample

	
Documentation

TODO:
- Describe all the macros
- Describe the output and how to make new ones

Future & ideas
--------------

- Add NULL pointers test with SHOULD_BE_NULL SHOULD_NOT_BE_NULL
- Add pending concept
- Check how to mock
- Put in place a story framework
- Automake autoconf


Compile and link
----------------

- Windows     : directory VC contains VC++ 6.0 dsw and dsp files to compile and link the library and the sample
- OS X /Linux : src and sample directories contain a Makefile to compile and link  the library and the sample
